|Notes|evidence|
|-----|---------|
|Video1|Very important: A **5min** video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from old. |
|Bonus: Xfold improvement| In some aspect of the code; theoretical complexity, runtime, memory, developer time...|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |[Description](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/tree/dev/docs/point-description) |
|Use of style checkers |[Yes](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/blob/dev/.github/workflows/style_checker.yml)|
|Use of code formatters. |[Yes](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/blob/dev/.github/workflows/style_checker.yml)|
|Use of syntax checkers. |[Yes](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/blob/dev/.github/workflows/style_checker.yml)|
|Use of code coverage |[Yes](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/blob/dev/.github/workflows/workflow.yml)|
|Other automated analysis tools|[Yes](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/blob/dev/.github/workflows/workflow.yml)|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...  but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| [Contribution of team members](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/graphs/contributors) |
|Number of commits| 136 (to be changed) |
|Number of commits: by different people| kalyan-karnati: , mukunda-p: , SakethVangala11:, srihithareddy-k: , PranaviSan: |
|Issues reports: there are **many**|
|Issues are being closed|[Yes, issues are being closed once after the functionality has been added. Here is the evidence of issues being closed.](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/issues)|
|DOI badge: exists|[Yes](https://zenodo.org/record/5746400#.Y44PknbMK3A)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |in GH|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| [Here are the use cases for the features.](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/blob/dev/docs/SE%20Project%20-%20USE%20CASES.md)|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| [Story and Motivation for the features](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/blob/dev/docs/Motivation_story.pdf) |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
|Use of version control tools| Github,Git |
|Test cases exist|[Yes](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/tree/dev/tests)|
|Test cases are routinely executed|[Yes](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/actions)|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a summary statement here|
|Chat channel: exists|Link or screenshots|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|  |
|Short release cycles | [4(shorts), 1(major release)](https://github.com/mukunda-p/vogueX---Fashion-Recommender/releases) |

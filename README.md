## üíéDescription</br>
Has it ever happened that you were all set with the perfect dress for your big day but you forgot to take a rain check? 

Well, don‚Äôt worry. Our fashion recommender is here to save your day. This ain‚Äôt any regular fashion recommender but a recommender that will look out for you not only in terms of style but in terms of comfort. Now you may think how would one do that? We do this by providing you choices based on:

  - Weather of the day, to let you know if you should avoid certain apparel or carry some extra accessories
  - Season to illustrate different patterns
  - Occasion to keep you in check with the highest rated choices 

And if this doesn‚Äôt seem enough, one can extend this in a thousand different ways, some of which are:

Integrating the health app with it to take an extra step and use the predicted menstrual cycle to enhance the outfit recommendation as to make it more comfortable.
Introducing a feedback mechanism to keep track of the user‚Äôs preferences in order to give better suggestions
Integrating the calendar app to take care of the important days and send a recommendation accordingly.

We have ‚ÄúA style for every story‚Äù so let it be known to the world :)

|Notes|evidence|
|-----|---------|
|Video1|Very important: A **5min** video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from old. |
|Bonus: Xfold improvement| In some aspect of the code; theoretical complexity, runtime, memory, developer time...|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |
|Use of style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|
|Use of code formatters. |config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
|Use of syntax checkers. |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
|Use of code coverage |config files in GH|
|Other automated analysis tools|config files in GH|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
|but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|evidence in GH|
|Number of commits|in GH|
|Number of commits: by different people|in GH|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|
|Issues are being closed|evidence in GH|
|DOI badge: exists|in GH|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |in GH|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
|Use of version control tools|
|Test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|Test cases are routinely executed|E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
|Chat channel: exists|Link or screenshots|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
